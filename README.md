# Transfer-unstructured-data-from-Excel-files-to-one-Excel-file
Python code. It transfers structure/unstructured data from a folder containing Excel files and collects them for you in one Excel file.


*It will transfer the data of the first 8 rows. You can manipulate that as you want!
*You can work on minor modifications on code to change file types other than Excel. I hope that is clear!
