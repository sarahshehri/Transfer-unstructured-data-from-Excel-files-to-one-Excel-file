# Transfer-unstructured-data-from-Excel-files-to-one-Excel-file
Python code. It transfers structure/unstructured data from a folder containing Excel files and collects them for you in one Excel file.



You can work on minor modifications on code to change file types other than Excel. I hope that is clear!
